Black Music Lab

looking at the Rosetta Reitz archive
Courtney Dantzler is a senior from Jacksonville, Florida, majoring in Music and Computer Science. She currently studies organ, jazz piano, and composition, but throughout her time at Duke she has also explored voice, musicology, and music technology. In the spring of 2022, Courtney spent a semester abroad in Vienna, Austria. What excites her about the lab is how the exploration of black musical traditions informs her study of what constitutes the “soul” in music.
