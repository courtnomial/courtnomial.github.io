                    Hi, I'm Courtney. I recently graduated from Duke University with an interdepartmental major in Music and Computer Science. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm excited to share my intellectual and professional journey with you. If you want me to get straight to the point, you can view my <a href="CDantzler Resume 2023.pdf">resume</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You might be interested in some of my creative samples from the last four years which include my explorations in text, sound, code, and film. This admittedly bare-bones portfolio website is still in development, so feel free to reach out to me by <a href=mailto:“cdantzler3692@gmail.com”>email</a> or DM me on <a href=https://www.instagram.com/courtnomial”>Instagram</a>!

						<p>This calculates the shortest Euclidean distance using Pythagorean theorem which allows me to compute the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, given the length of two sides.  Added a graphical interpretation to this, which was not part of the project, but seemed needed.  I assigned the x, y vectors to the monitor pixels and built draw methods.</p><a href = "https://youtu.be/CrNMABJJN24">Watch Program</a>

						<p>This is a console app that I created to add users with encrypted (hashed) passwords, create tickets for tracking bugs in software programs, search/update/delete tickets and users. Overall, this is the cleanest my code has been, with classes and methods. Great use of Object Oriented Programming.

						<h3><a href="https://github.com/Silcott/PORTFOLIO-OF-PROJECTS/tree/master/PROJECTS/MVC_CreatePerson">MVC Azure Razor Web Page - Create A Person</a></h3>
						<p>This is my first attempt at building a (MVC) Model, View, Controller pattern. I had a project to design a person class. Of course, I took it a few steps more, even though it does not look like much I decided to build a form with links, store the database with SQL, then deploy it with Azure. I became very familiar with string connections and how SQL and Azure relate.</p>

						<p>Designed a web scraper for CSV files from URL addresses, strips commas & spaces, separates every fifth line for questions, then builds list for answers.  The first answer is correct, so I built a randomizer & score mechanic.  Includes my first debugger, demonstrates behind the scenes functions.

						<p>This demonstrates a bisection algorithm to find a generated random number. The value can equal the middle value, be higher than the middle value, or be lower than the middle value. It recursively calls itself with the top half of the list when it is higher and if its lower it calls itself with the bottom of the list. <a href = "https://console-app-guessing-game.silcott.repl.run/"><p>Run Program</p></a></p>

						<p>Another C# program built with fun! Using inheritance, abstraction, classes, and objects, I implemented a military unit of tanks. Overall, lots of fun and learned a lot. I used dictionary and lists for the first time which turns out to make the ASCII art a lot easier to do animation.

I programmed the turtle to move around and draw a message, which in this case is telling myself Happy Birthday.  Not a bad program.  It was hard to figure out how to turn the turtle and create the heart shapes were a real challenge.  Enjoy!<a href = "https://repl.it/@silcott/Python-Turtle-Happy-Bday"><p>Run Program</a></p>

I got a little carried away with this project and wanted to maximize the screen and center the WriteLine’s, add some sounds, bring a little color and some ACSII text into the mix. I had a lot of fun building this. Enjoy!</p>

I used image overlaying to build the spires to scale.  I modified it to hold our patch which turned into an award for the base yearly winners. I also taught classes using Blender and Tinker CAD software to the community.<a href = "https://github.com/Silcott/PORTFOLIO-OF-PROJECTS/blob/master/PROJECTS/BlenderProjects/AFMemorial/AFM_11WG_Award/USAFMv3.stl"><p>View 3D Model</a></p>
